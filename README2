# We have 4 versions of our program:
#
# 1.	Our first, quickly thrown together version. No optimization what
#		so ever. To compile it, just run:

	bash compile.sh

# 2.	We tried a bitwise implementation for the project. Adding to that,
#		we started compiling with gcc:s -O3 optimization flag. To compile,
#		run:

	bash compile.sh

# 3.	At this point, we realized that out first version was actually faster
#		than the bitwise one. So we went back to that one and continued
#		optimization with that one. This is also our final program for the
#		optimization tests. To compile, run:

	make

# 3.1	Our last version, with a graphical presentation of the end state of
#		the game. The processing before that is the same as in ver3. To compile,
#		run:

	make
